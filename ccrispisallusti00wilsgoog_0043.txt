ι Argentum aere solutum. Some have s posed that aere here
is put for ex aerare‘O, and have understood, the meaning to be
that. the debis of individuale were paid out of the public trea-
sury. This conjecture is not only unsupported by proof but is
in itself absurd. The more probable meaning is, that creditore

were obliged by law to compound with their debtors· and to .

receive an as, which was of brass‚ for a sesterce, which was of
silver, A law of this kind, passed under the consulship of Va·
letius Flaccus, authorized debt ors to discharge their debts by
the payment of one· fourth of their value. 1f, as some asseri,
there were silver nesteron coined of the value of five asses, and
if an (ιε was aid instead of a sesterce, the creditor received
but oue- fifth o his debt. Reckoning two and a half aues to a
terreret, the creditor in this way received two-fifth: of his debt.
