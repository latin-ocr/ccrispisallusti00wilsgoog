c Sibyllinis. A certain woman, named Amalthm„ from a
foreign country, offered for sale to Tarquinius, Superbus, the
last king of Rome, nine books of the Sibylline, or pro hetie·
oraclo& but at an exorbitant price3 which Tarquin re using,
she burnt three of them, still demanding the same price for the
remaining six. Being ridiculed by the king, she but-nt three
rnore, without abatmg her price for the remaining three. Tar-
quin, surprized at her strange conduct, consuited the augure,
who, regi-etting the loss of the books which had been burnt,
‘advised the king to pay her demand, on delivery of the three
remaining books. Two persons at first, then ten, afterwards
fifteen were appointed to take charge of these books, hence
culed Qindecimviri. These books were supposed to conatu
the fate of the republic, and in time of public danger or ca·
lamity were consulted by order of the senate. They of course
became a very useful engine of state; but were burnt in the
· Mat-sic war, A. U. 690. Ambassadors were sent every where
to collect the eracles of the Sibyla, of whom there were seve·
tal: the chief of thern was the Sibyl of Cumoe. From the
verses collected in this search, the Quindecimoe‘ri compilet! new
books, which, by order of Augustus. were deposited in two
gilt cases under the base of Appollo’s statue, in his temple on
th'e Palatino hill.
